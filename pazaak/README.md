# Todo:
    1. Create pre match window to pick a side deck
        * User pick 10 cards
        * Side deck saves 10 user picked cards
            Later:
                * Game asks if player wants to conntinue with this side deck
                * Player can select No
                * Player can remove cards from side deck
    2. Game logic
        * Game draws 4 from side deck into players hand
        * player can end turn (draws a house card)
        * player can stand (no further action)
        * player can play card from hand (1 per turn)

## Stretch Goals
    1. Limited pool of initial starting cards
    2. Implement economy for player to purchase new cards
