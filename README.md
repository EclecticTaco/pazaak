## Rules of the Game
    The goal is to get closest but not over 20 compared to your oponent. 

    Pick 10 cards from the main deck into your side deck

    Once match begins, your hand will consist of 4 cards randomly chosen from your side deck

    At the beginning of each turn, you will recieve a house card that adds to your count.

    You have three choices per turn
        End Turn: 
            no cards played, you will recieve a house card at the beginning of your next turn.
        Stand:
            your current count is final. Wait for the oponent to finish playing. 
        Play a card:
            you can only play a single card per turn. Cards can either add or subtract to your count.
            Once a card is played, you can either end turn or stand
            
    If you hit 20 either on a house card draw or from playing a card from your hand:
        you win the round unless your opnent can reach 20 aswell.    
    If you recieve a house card that puts you over 20, you have to play a card to bring it below or to 20 in that turn. 
        If you are unable to, you bust out and lose the current round.
